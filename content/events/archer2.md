## Abstract
 
The ARCHER2 training service started in April 2020 with an online programme of courses and virtual tutorials. EPCC, as part of the ARCHER2 UK National service, deliver a training programme that covers a wide range of scientific disciplines and technology platforms, and addresses the training requirements of users with different needs and level of experience.

In this seminar, we will present our experience in delivering courses and designing a training programme based on the feedback received from our users and HPC training experts from around the world. We will also cover different user types and examples of training pathways suitable for them.
