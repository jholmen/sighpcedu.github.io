Just as Greg muddles his way through middle school in Diary of a Wimpy Kid,
Pawsey Interns are asked to navigate a confusing world of science and high performance computing – sometimes with little to no background in either.
Join this panel discussion to learn about the 10-week, paid Australian Internship Program as experienced by the Interns and Intern Mentors.
Hear their journeys, their challenges and their successes – from bootcamp training through to final project showcase.
