## Abstract
 
### Talk 1: Towards Sustainable HPC Workforce Development for the HPC Ecosystems Community in Africa

The HPC Ecosystems Project is responsible for the distribution and deployment of HPC Systems in Africa, as well as HPC Personnel training related to these systems.

Traditional training has been conducted onsite with all partners, but with an ever-growing community currently spanning over 35 sites and 150 international members, the core team of 10 staff from the CHPC are unable to practically meet the increasing demands for in-person training.

The presentation will provide a brief overview of the HPC Ecosystems Project's approach towards developing a sustainable HPC training curriculum for HPC partners throughout Africa, while addressing the myriad resource constraints associated with many partner institutions in Africa.

### Talk 2: Reaching new heights in coding: Success Story of 2023 Coding Summer School

The annual Coding Summer School (CSS), a collaborative effort between the CSIR's Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and the National Institute for Theoretical Computational Science (NITheCS), was held as a hybrid event for the first time this year, spanning two weeks from 30 January to 10 February 2023. Participants from across the country came together to learn the fundamentals of coding for high performance computing (HPC) and computational sciences.

The presentation will discuss end-to-end the planning, preparation, and execution of the CSS with a special focus on the learning stack that was used, i.e Canvas, Slack, and Zoom.
