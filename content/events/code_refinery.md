CodeRefinery has been teaching over 2500 researchers since 2016 in FAIR research software development practices. All training materials (https://coderefinery.org/lessons/core/) are publicly available for everyone to use for self-learning and reusing (CC-BY) and we offer two free online workshops a year where we try to reach hundreds of participants and dozens of team leaders. The lessons are collaboratively developed with contributions from Nordics and beyond. 

In this seminar we would like to share our experiences from taking CodeRefinery from small in person workshops to large interactive online workshops. We will also take a look into the future of the project and discuss involvement opportunities for individuals and organizations. 

### Speakers Bios

Samantha Wittke works as application specialist at CSC - IT center for Science, Finland. She started her journey into Research Software Engineering by visiting a CodeRefinery workshop in 2018 in the beginning of her still ongoing PhD work. She got inspired and became a workshop helper and later an instructor. In February 2024, Samantha started working as community manager for the project. She is also involved in basic and domain specific (Geoinformatics) high performance computing training, user support and outreach at CSC.

Radovan Bast is a research software engineer with a background in theoretical chemistry. He has previously worked in France and Sweden, and he is currently based in Norway. Radovan's work is at the border between science, software, and computational support, and he enjoys supporting multi-disciplinary research. Radovan now works as part of the Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services at the University of Troms√∏ (UiT), Norway, and leads the CodeRefinery project. At UiT he leads the high-performance computing group and the research software engineering group. His goal is to make HPC more accessible and usable through training.
