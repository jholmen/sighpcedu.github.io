Educational Award For Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education
=================================================================================

The ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter is pleased to announce the first recipient of the Educational Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education **Dr. Robert M. Panoff**.

Dr. Robert Panoff is noted for his work assisting faculty with the integration of computational science into the undergraduate curriculum. Dr. Panoff also collected and distributed curricular materials as exemplars for adoption in the curriculum. He is widely recognized for the development of Interactivate, a set of modeling tools to assist in the teaching of pre-college science and math.

He received many National Science Foundation grants that have focused on workshops for faculty, K-12 teachers and students. The workshops have led to widespread adoption of computational thinking and computational science into the curriculum. His other computational science education projects include Computational Science Education Reference Desk, the HPC University portal, the National Computational Science Institute, SC conference workshops, DEAF Stem, Braille through Remote Learning, SUCCEED curriculum, the Blue Waters Internship Program, and the XSEDE Empower Program. Links to these projects and the modeling tools can be found at [http://www.shodor.org.](http://www.shodor.org)

Dr. Panoff will receive a $2000 honorarium and will be honored at the award ceremony at the SC22 meeting in Dallas, Texas in November. **We commend Dr. Panoff for his lifelong contributions to computational science education.**

The award is co-sponsored by the SIGHPC Education Chapter and SIGHPC.

Basis for the Award
-------------------

The award for outstanding contributions to computational science education is based on these criteria:

*   The work provides innovative training and education materials for computational, data-enabled, and HPC education
*   The impact metrics for the project or program, if available
*   The work has received widespread adoption of their approach and/or materials by other groups/organizations
*   The project or program enhances the ability to engage, serve, and retain a diverse community of participants
*   The work has been recognized through presentations and publications.

The award is granted biennially. The next award competition will be in 2024.
