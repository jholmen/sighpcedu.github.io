# Training and Education Resources

The links below provide access to HPC Educational resources, K-12 (pre-university) educational resources, and educational resources for systems professionals. 
The materials include, but are not limited to, courses, tutorials, reference guides, repositories and websites.Â The HPC educational material has been roughly sorted and is grouped by experience level.

## HPC Resources

We have assembled a list of resources that include links to those just getting started with HPC to intermedicate and advanced users.

## Computational Science Resources

In addition to the HPC Resources, we have gathered 
general Computational Science Resources. The Computational Science resources have been sorted into two broad groups, one for general resources and one for resources that are domain specific, as noted in the file linked below.
