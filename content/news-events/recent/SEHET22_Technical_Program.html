NSF-supported cyberinfrastructure (CI) has been highly successful in advancing science and engineering over the last few decades. During that time, there have been significant changes in the size and composition of the participating community, the architecture and capacity of compute, storage, and networking platforms, and the methods by which researchers and CI professionals communicate. These changes require rethinking the role of research support services and how they are delivered. To address these changes and support an expanding community, MATCH is implementing a model for research support services in ACCESS that comprises three major themes: 1) leverage modern information delivery systems and simplify user interfaces to provide cost-effective, scalable, support to a broader community of researchers, 2) engage experts from the community to develop training materials and instructions that can drAMatically reduce the learning curve, and 3) employ a matchmaking service that will maintain a database of specialist mentors and student mentees that can be matched with projects to provide the domain-specific expertise needed to leverage ACCESS resources. A new ACCESS MATCH Portal (AMP) will serve as the single front door for researchers to obtain guided support and assistance. AMP will leverage emerging curated and tagged taxonomies to identify and match inquiries with knowledge base content and expertise. Expert-monitored question and answer platforms will be created to ensure researcher questions are accurately answered and addressed in a timely fashion, and easy-to-use interfaces such as Open OnDemand and Pegasus will be enhanced to simplify CI use and provide context-aware directed help. The result will be a multi-level support infrastructure capable of scaling to serve a growing research community with increasingly specialized support needs, resulting in research discoveries previously hindered by researchers’ inability to effectively utilize NSF CI resources. 
This talk will cover the components of the MATCH project and discuss how MATCH will engage and work with the ACCESS community.

	<br>
	<span style="color:Tomato;">Recent HPC education efforts have focused on maximizing the usage of traditional- and cloud-based computing infrastructures that primarily support CPU or GPU hardware. However, recent innovations in CPU architectures from Arm and RISC-V and the acquisition of Field-ProgrAMmable Gate Array (FPGA) companies by vendors like Intel and AMD mean that traditional HPC clusters are rapidly becoming more heterogeneous.

This work investigates one such exAMple deployed at Georgia Tech - a joint workflow for processor design and reconfigurable computing courses supported by both the HPC-focused Partnership for Advanced Computing Environments (PACE) and GT's novel architecture center, CRNCH. This collaborative workflow of HPC nodes and 40 remotely accessible Pynq devices supported over 100 students in Spring 2022, and its deployment provides key lessons on sticking points and opportunities for combined HPC and novel architecture workflows.

	<br>
	<span style="color:Tomato;">During the Education and Training Workshop at PEARC22, we plan to discuss the needs, requirements and strategies for building and implementing repositories that can be shared and exchanged AMong a diverse mix of institutions on a national and international scale. This will include working to create common metadata for publishing and exchanging training and educational material to facilitate common indexing and searching methods. To continue and build on the workshop presentation and discussion, we plan to propose the formation of a Repository Working Group within the ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter.

The use of computing technologies is expanding exponentially in every sector of our lives, creating a need for access to high-quality education and training materials to conduct research computing. Instructional materials for both teaching and learning are needed on a broad range of topics related to both developing and applying research computing technologies in all disciplines. The critical need for quality materials applies to formal classroom learning as well as to informal and self-paced learning.

Across the globe, academic, industrial, and government organizations develop local web-based repositories (i.e. portals or collections) where their stakeholders can access training and educational materials. However, organizations do not have common standards or protocols for publishing and discovering high-quality learning materials via their repositories.

While most people still use search engines like Google to discover materials, we believe there is a vital need for the curation of education and training repositories. Curated repositories can provide verification, validation, and accreditation information, reviews by peer groups, and roadmaps for learning.
One of the greatest benefits of common curation methods is providing easier access to materials that are high-quality, up-to-date, maintained, and relevant to people’s background and needs.

We believe that by promoting common strategies for structuring and indexing repositories, we can reduce the time and effort by people publishing and/or discovering quality HPC education and training materials.

	<br>
	<span style="color:Tomato;">Many Research-1 (R1) universities create investments in High Performance Computing (HPC) centers to facilitate grant-funded computing projects, leading to student training and outreach on cAMpus. However, creating an HPC workforce pipeline for undergraduates at non-research-intensive universities requires creative, zerocost education and exposure to HPC. We describe our approach
to providing HPC education and opportunities for students at California State University Channel Islands, a four-year university /
Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) with a primarily first-generationto-college LatinX student population. We describe how we educate
our university population in HPC without a dedicated HPC training budget. We achieve this by (1) integrating HPC topics and
projects into non-HPC coursework, (2) organizing a cAMpus-wide
data analysis and visualization student competition with corporate sponsorship, (3) fielding undergraduate teAMs in an external,
equity-focused supercomputing competition, and (4) welcoming
undergraduates into faculty HPC research. The net effect of this
multifaceted approach is that our graduates are equipped with core
competencies in HPC and are excited about entering HPC careers.

	<br>
	<span style="color:Tomato;">In order to fulfill the needs of an evolving job market, formal
academic progrAMs are continuously expanding computational
training in traditional discipline-specific courses. We developed
an informal, twelve contact-hour course tailored for economics
students entering a computationally rigorous graduate-level course
to help mitigate disparities in computing knowledge between
students and prepare them for more advanced instruction within
the formal setting. The course was developed to teach the R
progrAMming language to students without assuming any prior
knowledge or experience in progrAMming or the R environment.
In order to allow for ease of implementation across various
training approaches, the course is modularized with each section
containing distinct topics and learning objectives. These modules
can be easily developed as independent lessons so that
discipline-specific needs can be addressed through inclusion or
exclusion of certain topics. This implementation used the R
package ‘learnr’ to develop the course which rendered a highly
extensible and portable interactive Shiny document that can be
deployed on any system on which RStudio is installed. The course
is offered as a series of interactive sessions during which students
are led through the Shiny notebook by an instructor. Owing to its
structure, it can be offered as an asynchronous web-based set of
tutorials as well.

We describe key activities within three complementary thrusts: establishing a Workforce DeveloAMent and Retention Action Group, creating accessible ‘Intro to HPC’ training materials, and launching the Sustainable Research Pathways for High-Performance Computing (SRP-HPC) workforce develoAMent progrAM. We are leveraging ECP’s unique multilab partnership to work toward sustainable collaboration across the DOE community, with the long-term goal of changing the culture and demographic profile of DOE computing sciences.
